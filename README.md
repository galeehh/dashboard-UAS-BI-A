the Southeast Asian e-commerce sector has experienced remarkable growth, with a 30.1% increase in transaction value reaching Rp. 403.2 trillion in 2023 compared to the previous year. This rapid expansion provides lucrative opportunities for e-commerce businesses to boost their sales. Employing predictive methods, such as multiple linear regression, proves instrumental in forecasting monthly sales, aiding in strategic planning for setting sales targets, implementing effective marketing strategies, and managing inventory.
The application of multiple linear regression to monthly sales data from an Indonesian e-commerce company, considering variables like website visitors, monthly transactions, average items per transaction, customer satisfaction rating, and online advertisements, yielded a model with a high predictive accuracy. The R-squared value of 0.91 indicates that 91% of the monthly sales variability can be explained by the independent variables.
Specifically, the analysis highlights the significance of variables “x2” (number of monthly transactions) and “x5” (number of online advertisements) as strong predictors for monthly sales. The correlation plot emphasizes the strong positive relationships among all variables, indicating that an increase in each independent variable corresponds to an increase in the dependent variable.
Further exploration of the variable relationships, particularly the positive correlation between “x2” (number of monthly transactions) and “y” (monthly sales), provides actionable insights. The resulting scatter plot graph illustrates the positive relationship, suggesting that as the number of transactions increases, monthly sales also tend to rise. This information allows the e-commerce company to leverage factors influencing monthly sales, such as increasing the number of transactions (“x2”), to enhance overall sales performance.
In practical terms, this analysis informs the e-commerce company that optimizing factors like the number of transactions can positively influence monthly sales. Utilizing this information, the company can make informed decisions to enhance its strategic approach, capitalize on growth opportunities, and ultimately improve its overall performance in the dynamic Southeast Asian e-commerce landscape.
